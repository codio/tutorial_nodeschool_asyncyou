Write a program that will receive two command line arguments containing
the hostname and port. Using `http.request` send a POST request to

    url + '/users/create'

with the body containing a JSON.stringify'ed object;

    {user_id : 1}

Do this five times with each the `user_id` property being incremented starting
at 1.

Once these requests are done send a GET request to 

    url + '/users'

and console.log the response body.
